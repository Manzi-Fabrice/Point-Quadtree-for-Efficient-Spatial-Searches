This project implements a point quadtree data structure for efficient spatial searches and collision detection in two-dimensional space. The quadtree enables fast lookup and insertion of points, and it can quickly determine which points fall within a specified region or detect collisions among moving points. The implementation includes methods for point insertion, region search, and collision handling, and provides interactive GUI applications for visualization and testing.
